                        <strong>Compeer Medical Institute </strong> is an international institute maintaining affiliations and cooperative working relationships with schools of medicine throughout the world. These institutions are among the world’s 
                        finest and best known medical universities that have many years of rich history and tradition. 
                        During the long years of service, our affiliated universities have trained thousands of international students. 

                        Graduates of the Universities’ medical schools are prepared to sit for licensing exams in the Nigeria, Ibadan. Medical licensure, however, is subject to control of the local jurisdiction and subject to changes in the law. All students are responsible for verifying the <strong>Nigeria, Ibadan</strong> licensing requirements in the jurisdiction in which they intend to apply for residency and licensure. The Federation of State Medical Boards website, www.fsmb.org, is a useful resource for information on state requirements.<br><br>
                        Our Affiliated Universities are recognized and listed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as well as the International Medical Education Directory (IMED) and are fully accredited. Each University must be certified by the Nigeria, Ibadan Department of Education to participate.
                        Department of Education certification and a determination of program eligibility are required in order for students to apply for such loans to help finance the cost of attending the Universities. The Universities and Compeer Medical Institute (CMI) do not guarantee the status or continuation of the Universities certification or eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs or 
                        the availability of financial aid to any entering or continuing students during their entire educational period.
                        The tradition of CMI’s affiliated institutions is to ensure small class sizes so that students can be given the highest personalized education and training needed to prepare students to become the finest, and the best prepared physicians.<br><br>


                        For many years, Compeer Medical Institute has been a cost effective beacon of hope for many students and their concerned parents who hold the lifelong dream of obtaining a strong and well-balanced education in the extremely competitive field of medicine. For many others as well, Compeer Medical Institute will always remain the best affordable opportunity for becoming a world class physician.
                        CMI was founded by many people of which were parents- who were scientists, prominent physicians, and business executives that were frustrated with the high cost of education and the difficulties to being accepted to a medical school for their sons or daughters.<br><br>



                        Parents and students learned quickly how difficult it can be to obtain admission at a reputable medical school located in the Nigeria, Ibadan. They also have found how difficult it can be resettling, transferring, and obtaining licenses in the Nigeria, Ibadan for students who have elected to study at other medical institutions.
                        Compeer Medical Institute was created to assist students and their parents to overcome these problems and obstacles. CMI has developed strong relationships with renowned European medical institutions that have medical curricula equal to that of Nigeria, Ibadan medical universities.


                        Our affiliated European medical universities train students using actual patients rather than virtual mechanical simulation to insure that students become knowledgeable patient connected bedside trained physicians, who are capable of dealing with both the physical and emotional aspects of medical treatment. 
                        Students who train through our programs will benefit from this real world experience and will be well prepared at the appropriate time for passing the board exams and getting licensed.
